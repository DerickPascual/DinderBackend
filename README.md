# A backend for my web app Diner -- Tinder for Restaurants
Try it at: [letsdiner.com](https://www.letsdiner.com)

This web app helps partners and friends decide where to go to eat using Tinder-style rooms. Swipe left to indicate that you don't want to go to a restaurant, and swipe right to indicate you do. Restaurants are fetched using Google Places API.

This backend was built with socket.io, Express, Node.js, and Google Places node client.
